Mostly good work.  You didn't complete perceptron.py, so here are my comments on 
your regression code:

    1) Try to keep pathnames as simple as possible, so they will work on different
       operating systems: use 'assign1_data.txt' instead of r'.\assign1_data.txt'.

    2) For the final regression test (25/50/75) you should get 96% for all three
       conditions.  I've included my solution (levy_regression.py) if you'd like
       to compare it to yours.
